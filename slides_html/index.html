		In 1975 we get DES.
		DES is the first serious attempt at a widespread standard for data security.
		It was successfully impelmented in chip, which made it easy to sell and use.
		An example of a DES impelmentation is HBO used DES to scramble the signal when transmitting it over satellite.
		Even though the NSA was involved in the design of the cipher, the only real weakness in DES is that it shipped with a 56 bit key strength.
		The designers wanted a 128 bit length key, but hardware concerns limited it to 64 bit, and government interference got it down to 56 bits.

		Each single bit reduction cuts the strength in half.  100 bit is twice as strong as 99 bit.  99 bit twice as strong as 98.

		Symmetric cryptography is the easier to understand type of encryption.
		You have a key and an scrambling algorithm.
		You combine your data, the key, and the algorithm and you scramble your data.
		The recipient takes the same key and a reverse process to unscramble the data to recover the plaintext
		If you can keep the key secret, this works really well.

		Mainframes needed to talk to one another in a secure way.

		This is the hardest to understand part of modern symmetric encryption.
		Each round of encryption you take a chunk of bytes, and perform a lookup operation with the values themselves.
		You take your current value, and use it to find the new value.
		Your chunk is 68. Go find (6, 8) > 45.  Now next round your chunk is 45.
		Do that 12 or 16 times combined with a shuffle operation after each step and you have the makings of a strong block cipher.
		These s-boxes are hardcoded, and the values in the s-boxes are what makes them strong.
		The NSA provided the s-boxes for DES.
		Since the operation is so complex there is no way to verify that there is no hidden trap door in the s-box
		Does the NSA have a special set of decoder s-boxes that allow them to more quickly guess your key?

		They and a bunch of smart folks focused on the most obvious limitations of symmetric crypto which is that no matter how strong the cipher is your key can be leaked.
		Their solution is to break the key up into two parts.  Where one part could be leaked, or even publicized.  And one part would be kept secret.  All you would need to send a person a message is their publicly available information.  You combine that with your private information, and that can establish a secure communication channel.

		You create a sign object and update the object with the message,
		you call the sign method and pass your private key
		You send your message, your signature, and your public key to the other party
		the other party can create a verify object, update it with the message

		<p>In 1989 RSA is licensed to be used in Lotus Notes.  </p>
		<p>They wanted to use a combination of RSA and DES for the encryption but the NSA would not allow them to export DES. </p>
		<p>So the RSA people invented the RC-2 cipher at two strengths, 64bit and 40 bit. </p>

		<p>crypto is more than just the math, or key generation steps</p>
		<p>it's the implementation of a set of protocols that define
		  key generation,
			key distribution,
			rings of trust and verification,
			handshake protocols,
			trusted and untrusted pipes</p>
		<p>every step brings with it benefits and drawbacks</p>
		<p>you can't just say "Oh I'll use RSA and AES" and leave it at that</p>
		<p>all the parties have to agree on every detail or things don't work at all</p>
		<p>future versions of software have to support the standard that created old messages or those old messages won't be readable</p>
		<p>your encryption protocol also has to work in the real world, on untrusted networks, that time out... so every step in your protocol needs special attention paid as invisible changes in underlying configurations can leave your implementation weak</p>
		<p>did your ISP change how packets are routed and now you are leaking your keys?</p>
		<p>can your software handle untrusted networks or does it expect everyone to be law abiding</p>
