						The NSA is feeling good.
						Anyone who wants to work on cryptography goes and works for them.
						They control the funding mechanisms for cryptography.
						They can also delcare patent applicaitons to be classified in the name of national security.
						All the knowledge is kept by them behind the triple-fence.

					<aside class='notes'>
						In 1975 we get DES.
						DES is the first serious attempt at a widespread standard for data security.
						It was successfully impelmented in chip, which made it easy to sell and use.
						It was also approved by the NSA who designed the S-Boxes utilized in the cipher.  We'll get to what an S-Box is in a few slides.

					<h3>symmetric cryptography</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Symmetric encryption is the easy to understand type of encryption.
						You have a key and an scrambling algorithm that you apply to your data to obscure it.
						The recipient takes the same key and a reverse process to unscramble the data.
						If you can keep the key secret, this works really well.

						DES is still around.
						You can find it and other symmetric ciphers by running getCiphers()
						This functionality is available to node because we link OpenSSL during compilation.
						Node crypto is powered by openssl.

					<h1>secure telephony</h1>
					<aside class='notes'>
						IBM needed a way for their mainframes to talk to one another in a secure way.
						They also needed a way to store information at rest.
						Their researchers with the assistance of the NSA succeded in their task.
						They created a block-cipher which took a fixed block of bytes, and performed multiple rounds of permutations.
						These permutations take the form of a fixed shuffle procedure after each round of substitutions.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>s-box</h1>
					<img src='img/s-box.png'></img>
					<aside class='notes'>
						This is the hardest to understand part of modern symmetric encryption.
						Each round of encryption you take a chunk of bytes, and perform a lookup operation with the values.
						The value of your bytes are the indexes, and the entry is the output value.
						Your chunk is 68. Go find (6, 8) > 45.  Now next round your chunk is 45.
						Do that 12 or 16 times comebined with a shuffle operation and you have the makings of a strong block cipher.
						These s-boxes are hardcoded, and the values in the s-boxes are what makes them strong.
						The NSA provided the s-boxes for DES.
						Since the operation is so complex there is no way to verify that there is no hidden trap door in the s-box that the NSA knows how to exploit to reduce the strength of the scrambling.
						Does the NSA have a special set of decoder s-boxes that allow them to more quickly guess your key?

				<section data-background-image='img/burns_float.gif'>
					<h1>DES</h1>
					<aside class='notes'>
						So back to DES... it was a hit, we still use a version of it today.
						Even thoug the NSA reduced the key size in their recommendation, it was secure and widespread.
						It put cryptography outside of the realm of the military and spies.
