		My talk today is going to cover a bit of history, some math, and a fair bit of code examples.
		The underlying motivation in all of this is based in the desire for a group of people to exercise the right best summarized here in article 12 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights
		Not only are you protected from interference with your correspondence and you privacy but it lists the stakes involved: honor and reputation.
		The word attack is also really strong language, no where else in the document do you get such strong language.  You mostly see words like deprived, and persectuion.
		While I'm going to talk a lot about people starting businesses and patent fights between academics, the people doing the fighting are fighting for the rights of everyone to be secure in their correspondence.

		In 1975 we get DES.
		DES is the first serious attempt at a widespread standard for data security.
		It was successfully impelmented in chip, which made it easy to sell and use.
		An example is HBO used DES to scramble the signal when transmitting it over satellite.
		Even though the NSA was involved in the design of the cipher, the only real weakness in DES is that it shipped with a 56 bit key strength.
		The designers wanted a 128 bit length key, but hardware concerns limited it to 64 bit, and government interference down to 56 bits.
		Each single bit reduction cuts the strength in half.  100 bit is twice as strong as 99 bit.  99 bit twice as strong as 98.
		So think about the reduction in strength from 128 to 56.

	<h3>symmetric cryptography</h3>
	<aside class='notes'>
		Symmetric cryptography is the easy to understand type of encryption.
		You have a key and an scrambling algorithm.
		You combine your data, the key, and the algorithm and you scramble your data.
		The recipient takes the same key and a reverse process to unscramble the data.
		If you can keep the key secret, this works really well.

		Mainframes to talk to one another in a secure way.
		They also needed a way to store information at rest.
		Researchers with the assistance of the NSA succeded in their task.
		They created a block-cipher which took a fixed block of bytes, and performed multiple rounds of permutations.
		Specifically the permutations are multiple rounds of shuffling and substitution.

<section>
	<h1>s-box</h1>
	<img src='img/s-box.png'></img>
	<aside class='notes'>
		This is the hardest to understand part of modern symmetric encryption.
		Each round of encryption you take a chunk of bytes, and perform a lookup operation with the values themselves.
		You take your current value, and use it to find the new value.
		Your chunk is 68. Go find (6, 8) > 45.  Now next round your chunk is 45.
		Do that 12 or 16 times combined with a shuffle operation after each step and you have the makings of a strong block cipher.
		These s-boxes are hardcoded, and the values in the s-boxes are what makes them strong.
		The NSA provided the s-boxes for DES.
		Since the operation is so complex there is no way to verify that there is no hidden trap door in the s-box
		Does the NSA have a special set of decoder s-boxes that allow them to more quickly guess your key?

		They and a bunch of smart folks focused on the most obvious limitations of symmetric crypto which is that no matter how strong the cipher is your key can be leaked.
		Their solution is to break the key up into two parts.  Where one part could be leaked, or even publicized.  And one part would be kept secret.  All you would need to send a person a message is their publicly available information.  You combine that with your private information, and that can establish a secure communication channel.

		then in 1997 the case closes with no charges filed
		it's all just threats and intimidation
		I had a hard time researching hard concrete details about this talk because there is very little in the way of publicly available court proceedings
		You can't find a listing of what was and wasn't considered illegal at the time because it was entirely at the discretion of opaque government entities that would swing back and forth their interpretation of the current state of affairs
		the law was being practiced through secret letters and memos

	<h1>key escrow</h1>
	<aside class='notes'>
		so rewind a bit...
		it's 1993 so the whole time they are investigating email and software people for their
		strong encryption the government is pushing their solution for all this mess,
		which is key escrow, and later a softened term: key recovery
		a device called the clipper chip symbolized key escrow
		it would be built into your phone, and before you could make an encrypted connection with your 2nd party, a 3rd party would be given some or all of the symmetric keys to your encrypted communications

		so if law enforcement needed the contents of an encrypted wiretap
		(which would sound like a wall of hissing)
		they could supoena the key from the 3rd party and get the information they wanted

		nobody wanted on this train, not commerce, not the public
		not even after the government decided that there would be some flexibility
		in who the 3rd party was
		consumers could choose who stored their keys
		the big idea was that banks would keep them
		imagine if your API services involved contacting a bank with every transaction

		the real nail in the coffin for key escrow was that the implementations failed miserably under the smallest bit of scrutiny
		on the first day looking researchers were able to bypass the mechanisms that enforced the key escow
		the first crack meant waiting 40 minutes on hold before the connection was brute forced
		and faster attacks appeared later

	<h1>liberalization</h1>
	<aside class='notes'>
		<p>there is this whole period of liberalization after the clipper is hacked</p>
		<p>1996 An executive order comes down that transfers control of crypto from munitions regulators to the commerce department, you just ask for certifications for internal distribution and you are generally granted them</p>
		<p>1997 Banks are allowed unrestricted encryption access without key recovery, also you can export 56 bit crypto instead of 40 bit</p>
		<p>1998 Al Gore is about to start his campaign for president and they issue a memo basically making it a free-for-all in terms of strength and streamlines the process for export approval</p>

	<h1>review</h1>
	<aside class='notes'>
		before I talk about the threats of today I want to review a few concepts and how they relate
		crypto is more than just the math, or key generation steps
		it's the implementation of a set of protocols that define
		  key generation,
			key distribution,
			rings of trust,
			handshake protocols,
			trusted and untrusted pipes
		every step brings with it benefits and drawbacks
		you can't just say "Oh I'll use RSA and AES" and leave it at that
		all the parties have to agree on every detail or things don't work at all
		future versions of software have to support the standard that created old messages or those old messages won't be readable
		your encryption protocol also has to work in the real world, on untrusted networks, that time out... so every step in your protocol needs special attention paid as invisible changes in underlying configurations can leave your implementation weak
		did your ISP change how packets are routed and now you are leaking your keys?
		we trust our ISPs to not attack our connections, but that isn't the case for many internet users
		people behind the great-firewall in china design their cryptography software to account for different things than we expect on our mostly unrestricted connections
